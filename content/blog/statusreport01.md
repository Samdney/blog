*This article is the first one of a new series, a kind of newsletter,
for updating you what have happened in the last weeks or months related
to my work as independent mathematical research scientist and also a bit
about my art work. I will try to give my best to publish it as regular
as possible, but this will not be always possible. Sometimes because of
a leak of time but also sometimes because I work on security and privacy
sensitive projects which canâ€™t be make public, at the moment.
Nevertheless, I hope you will enjoy this updates and will become a
supporter of my work.*

**Stuff which Iâ€™m doing currently.** At the moment, I have mainly a lot
of writing tasks:

-   *Design draft for project 0055.* (Decentralized privacy preserving
    search by mathematical design (DePPSMaD)). This document will
    describe the first draft of the design of the search engine. Itâ€™s to
    bring my messy paper notes in a clearer state and get everything
    ordered. You can find the current state of document here:

    For general information about project 0055 look at:

-   *YaCy Intern Concept.* I got the possibility for a grant paid
    internship at YaCy
    (<a href="https://yacy.net/" title="External: YaCY" target="_blank">https://yacy.net/</a>)
    decentralized search engine. It will be about bringing more Machine
    Learning to YaCy. Before, I have to put the working topics on a
    working plan concept paper, at first.

-   *Patent application.* In the last months, I have worked on a larger
    practical project which finally led to patent applications. Now, I
    write technical stuff, handle patent lawyers and figure out how to
    get money for the patent costs.

-   *overflow.* I signed up at
    <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/users/147606/samdney" title="External: Mathoverflow" target="_blank">Mathoverflow</a>
    and
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/12262987/samdney" title="External: Stackoverflow" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a>
    for starting a new Q&A career there ðŸ˜œ.

-   *Medium.* Writing several Medium articles about meshnetworks and
    their meaning for political activism, hashtable in distributed
    networks, Machine Learning usage by search engines, â€¦.

-   *Project and fundings.* I have a list of other projects on which I
    want to work in the future. I will talk about them more in detail in
    another article. Hence, Iâ€™m currently looking for possible grants,
    fundings, crowdfundings and fellowships which could fit to them and
    keeping their deadlines in mind.

-   *The Film Fund.* I found this nice short film funding. Hence, Iâ€™m
    thinking intensevely about the right application sentence for my
    \#Hashtag short film series
    (<a href="https://youtu.be/K_anslmFTKA" title="External: Youtube #Hashtag Trailer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/K\_anslmFTKA</a>).

-   *Getting living expenses short term.* Because of private issues, I
    have to organize very short term income, at the moment, until I get
    money from my grants. Until now, this hasnâ€™t worked well. ðŸ˜ž

I hope you like this short update and see you next time, again! ðŸ˜‰
