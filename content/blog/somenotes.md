summary:    Sometimes, ...

Sometimes I wish that I would live in the Stone Age. In a world without any stupid borders which divide humans in groups and countries which are the result of wars, destruction and the dead of millions of people.

Nationalism is to be proud to be the descendant of people who start wars for religious reason or since they wanted a part of area. They destroyed homes & killed people. And now, today, you are the lucky guy who was born on the right side of this bloody border line(?)
